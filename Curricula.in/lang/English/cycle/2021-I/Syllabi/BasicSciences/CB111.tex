\begin{justification}
   The course develops the knowledge and skills to recognize, evaluate and apply the effects of physical phenomena related to mechanics in the field of engineering. In industry in general, the control of processes, the operation of machines, their maintenance, etc., are always governed by some kind of physical manifestation. Because of this, it is important for the student to understand the foundations of physical phenomena, the laws that govern them, their manifestation and the way to detect them. This course will allow the student to understand and identify the physical phenomena related to mechanics in order to control their effects on some technical process.
