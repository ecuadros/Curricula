\begin{justification}
This course is part of the training area of technology-based companies, 
aims to address all processes and good practices in the 
project management recommended by the \textit{Project Management Institute} (PMI) 
contained in the \textit{Project Management Body of Knowledge 2012} (PMBOK)  
applied in particular to technology-based projects such as 
construction, development, integration and implementation of 
application software.

The future professional who intends to venture into a 
software in the competitive globalised market, it must necessarily 
know the hard skills and practice the soft skills that are 
considered in the PMBOK. All contracts for the supply of goods 
(Hardware) or intangible (Software) as well as the services of 
consulting should be handled as small projects.

We believe it is of utmost importance to impart the fundamentals and experiences 
associated with project management to future professionals, 
we must consider that currently the client companies 
(national or international) that demand solutions require 
consulting companies to carry out system projects 
and information technology with PMI standards, 
more and more turns out to be a condition of exigibility to be able to win 
tenders and sign contracts for the supply of technology solutions, 
It also requires that the project leader, in addition to his or her training and 
experience to bring the project to a successful conclusion is a PMP.
