\begin{justification}
   The aim of this course is to provide the future professional with knowledge, attitudes and skills that will enable him/her to form his/her own software development and/or IT consultancy company. The course is divided into three units: Project Assessment, Services Marketing and Negotiations. In the first unit, the student will be able to analyze and make decisions regarding the viability of a project and/or business.

   In the second unit, the aim is to prepare the student to carry out a satisfactory marketing plan of the good or service that his company can offer to the market. The third unit seeks to develop the negotiating skills of the participants through experiential and practical training and theoretical knowledge that will allow them to close contracts where both the client and the supplier are winners. We consider these issues to be extremely critical in the launch, consolidation and eventual re-launching stages of a technology-based company.
\end{justification}
