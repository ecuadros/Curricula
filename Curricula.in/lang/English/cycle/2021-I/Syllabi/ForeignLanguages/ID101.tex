\begin{justification}
The learning of the English language in higher level students has become a necessary 
element for their academic, personal and professional development.
Most of the academic literature from the various fields of knowledge is written in English, 
which ensures that people with a command of the language can always be up-to-date.

Likewise, knowledge of this language allows broader social and cultural perspectives. 
In this sense, for effective language learning, the development of the four (4) 
skills is necessary; listen, speak, read and write considering the guidelines of the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages - CEFR.
\end{justification}
