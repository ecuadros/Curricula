\begin{justification}
Higher Education students are required to learn English for their own academic, 
personal, and professional growth. Most of the academic literature uses English, 
so English speakers are more updated regarding their field latest information. 
Besides, knowing a new language implies having opened social and 
cultural perspectives.  

To acquire the language properly is necessary to develop the four skills;
listening, talking, reading, and writing considering the 
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages - CEFR.
\end{justification}

\begin{goals}
\item Communicate information in a limited way in generally predictable situations.
\item Reach level B1 according to the CEFR.
\item Manage terminology specific to the field of study.
\end{goals}
