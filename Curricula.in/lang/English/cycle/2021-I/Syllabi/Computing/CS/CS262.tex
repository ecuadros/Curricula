\begin{justification}
Research in Artificial Intelligence has led to the development of numerous relevant tonic, aimed at the automation of human intelligence, giving a panoramic view of different
algorithms that simulate the different aspects of the behavior and the intelligence of the human being.
\end{justification}

\begin{goals}
\item Evaluate the possibilities of simulation of intelligence, for which the techniques of knowledge modeling will be studied.
\item Build a notion of intelligence that later supports the tasks of your simulation.
\end{goals}
