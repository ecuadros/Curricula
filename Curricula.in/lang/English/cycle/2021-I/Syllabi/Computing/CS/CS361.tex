\begin{justification}
  It provides a set of tools to solve problems that are difficult to solve with traditional algorithmic methods. Including heuristics, planning, formalisms in the representation of knowledge and reasoning, machine learning techniques, techniques applicable to action and reaction problems: as well as the learning of natural language, artificial vision and robotics among others.
