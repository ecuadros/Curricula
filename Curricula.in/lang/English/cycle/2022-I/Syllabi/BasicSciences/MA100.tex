\begin{justification}
The course aims to develop in students the skills to deal with models in science and engineering related to single variable differential calculus skills. In the course it is studied and applied concepts related to calculation limits, derivatives and integrals of real and vector functions of single real variables to be used as base and support for the study of new contents and subjects. 
Also seeks to achieve reasoning capabilities and applicability to interact with real-world problems by providing a mathematical basis for further professional development activities.
