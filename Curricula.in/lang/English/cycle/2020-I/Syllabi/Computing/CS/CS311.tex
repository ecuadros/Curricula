\begin{justification}
    Competitive Programming combines problem-solving challenges with the fun of competing with others. It teaches participants to think faster and develop problem-solving skills that are in high demand in the industry.
    This course will teach you to solve algorithmic problems quickly by combining theory of algorithms and data structures with practice solving problems.
  \end{justification}
